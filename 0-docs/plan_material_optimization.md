## 1. Objective

- What is the purpose of the tutorial?
To understand Chiral and build a first workflow implementation for material simulation

- Specific learning goals (e.g., learn how to run an MD simulation, practice docking workflow, visualize trajectories).
Learn how to create a material and run the optimization and properties calculation

- Target audience (e.g., beginners, intermediate, advanced users).
Beginner

- Scope and limitations (e.g., covers only ligand preparation, no QM part).
A simple and universal approach for theoretical material study, and also applicable for molecular/drug design.
